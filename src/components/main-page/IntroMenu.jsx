            Our focus is on freshly brewed coffee; available as espresso,
            hand-brew filter, batch-brew filter and, naturally, all of your
            milk-based favourites.
          </p>
          <p className="intro_menu_text">
            We work with a local dairy to ensure the best of milks and have a
            long-standing relationship with Oatly for those of you of a vegan
            persuasion.
          </p>
          <p className="intro_menu_text">
            We source our coffee from all across Europe but we do tend to shine
            a light on the under-represented scenes of the countries to the east
            of Leipzig and as such regularly serve the best filter roasts coming
            out of the Czech Republic, Poland and beyond.
          </p>
          <p className="intro_menu_text">
            Filter coffee changes weekly (sometimes sooner, when they prove to
            be really popular) so there is always something new to experience.
          </p>
          <p className="intro_menu_text">
            The house espresso is roasted by our good friends in MÃ¼nster,
            Roestbar. We created this blend to cut through milk and deliver the
            flavours of a spiced hot chocolate, despite there being not a hint
            of cocoa or a spice insight.
